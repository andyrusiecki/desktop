# Desktop Configurations

Various install scripts and configuration files for setting up desktop environments on different Linux distributions.

## TODOs

- [ ] update arch setup to use archinstall (separate version)
- [ ] take stock of currently installed packages
  - [ ] native arch packages
  - [ ] AUR packages
- [ ] check for extra local modifications since install (config files, udev rules, systemd services, reflector configs, etc.)
